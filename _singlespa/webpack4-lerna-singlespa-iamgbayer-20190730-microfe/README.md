# Microfrontends

> A practical approach to micro frontends architecture, this is a POC.

### About

- Deploys are independent because each service is delivered in different domains
- The codebase of each service is independent with monorepo
- Share global data between services with `customProps`

### Improvements

- Webpack configurations
- Reuse third-party bundle between services with a common bundle
- Environment settings
- Trigger independents deploys based on package changes
